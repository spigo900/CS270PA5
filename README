# CS 270 Project 5, "A small server"
by Joseph Cecil and Owen McGrath

A small server which responds to various requests, along with a library for
clients and several clients which serve as thin wrappers around these library
calls.

## Features & limitations
### sserver interface
Users of the sserver library code are expected to provide their own buffers for
sserver to fill. sserver functions taking a result buffer will attempt to fill
the buffer if they are passed a non-null pointer.

### Variable storage
The server treats variable contents as an arbitrary sequence of bytes rather
than as a string. A limitation of the smallSet client is that it always treats
variable content as a string; this does not affect the sserver library function
`smallSet()`.

## Known bugs
None.
